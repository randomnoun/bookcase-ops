So you'll need a DNS server, because the DNS servers inside kubernetes seem to be mostly for directing traffic within kubernetes. And you'll need DHCP to bootstrap DNS.

## Overview

OK so my local network will have a domain suffix of `.dev.randomnoun` and the hosts within that suffix are allocated IPs in the 192.168.0.x subnet.

The various hostnames and aliases below correspond to the various boxes on [SETUP-ARCHITECTURE.md](SETUP-ARCHITECTURE.md)

I'm running DHCP/DNS services  on a box outside the cluster, but I guess we could burn up some more resources on `bnehyp05` and do it there instead.

You could probably configure this on your wifi/internet router if your router has a DNS server in it, which it probably does.

In this setup, I'm using:

* **isc-dhcp-server** for DHCP ( IP address discovery, DNS discovery ), and 
* **bind** to provide DNS ( domain name -> IP address )

Actually, if you do install isc-dhcp-server / bind , you'll probably have to disable DHCP on your router, if your router has a DHCP server in it, which it probably does.

You might be able to get away with updating your hosts file ( `/etc/hosts` on linux, `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows ) instead of running bind.



## Installing isc-dhcp-server

```
sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
```

## Configuring isc-dhcp-server

* Add this to the end of /etc/dhcpd.conf:

```
# all the custom stuff
include "/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.local";
```

* Create a `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.local` file

If you're reading this and you're not me, then the things you probably want to change are:
* the artficial top-level domain ( `dev.randomnoun` )
* the IP address for your gateway ( `192.168.0.1` )
* the IP address for your ISP's DNS server ( `203.12.160.35` )
* any of the other IP addresses I guess, seeing those are going to be on your local network. I'm using `192.168.0.x` as my local subnet.

Contents of `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.local` file: 

```
# option definitions common to all supported networks
option domain-name "dev.randomnoun";

# DNS servers are bnehyp02, then TPG if it's down
# If TPG isn't your ISP then use your ISP's DNS here
option domain-name-servers 192.168.0.24, 203.12.160.35;

default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

# going to dish out IPs from 192.168.0.x
option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255;
option routers 192.168.0.1;

# IPs for unknown devices will range from 192.168.0.200 - 192.168.0.250
subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 192.168.0.200 192.168.0.250;
}

# MAC -> IP mappings
include "/etc/dhcp/dhcpd-hosts.conf";
```

* Create a `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd-hosts.conf` file.

If you're reading this and you're not me, then the things you probably want to change are:

* Pretty much everything. The hostnames below are the hosts in [SETUP-ARCHITECTURE.md](SETUP-ARCHITECTURE.md) which you'll probably have different names for
* The MAC addresses are the physical MACs on those boxes
* Apart from the virtual machine addresses, which were randomly generated by using [https://dnschecker.org/mac-address-generator.php](https://dnschecker.org/mac-address-generator.php) with a prefix of '00:00:' so it's a bit easier to see which ones are the randomly generated ones.

```

* Restart isc-dhcp-server via `sudo service isc-dhcp-server restart`
* Check status via `sudo service isc-dhcp-server status`
* Fix up any errors that might be appearing in `/var/log/syslog` 


## Installing bind

Steps to do that:

```
sudo apt-get install bind9
```

## Configuring bind


* Add this to the end of `/etc/bind/named.conf.local`

```
zone "dev.randomnoun" {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/db.dev.randomnoun";
};
zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
        type master;
        notify no;
        file "/etc/bind/db.192";
};
```

* Create the file  `/etc/bind/db.dev.randomnoun` containing:

```
;

Well yes, I've had the bookcase for a while, and this is not the entire list of crap I've got connecting to this network.

# Troubleshooting

## Setting up DNS search domains

So I reinstalled Ubuntu ( 22.04.1 LTS ) because gnome or X or the graphics driver seized up again after an upgrade, and rediscovered this little doozy after following the steps above. It's not really DHCP/DNS related, but I guess this needs to go somewhere.

You know how Ubuntu reinvents their network stack configuration process with every LTS release ? Well, that's going to happen again.

First off, try to set up your server with a static address using the 'Network Manager' found up the top-right of the Unity desktop.

You'll find that you can't specify a 'DNS search domain', because apparently that's not worthy of including in the GUI any more, so instead  edit the `/etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml` file so that it contains:

```
# Let NetworkManager manage all devices on this system
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: NetworkManager
  ethernets:
    eno1:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses:
        - 192.168.0.24/24
      nameservers:
        search: [dev.randomnoun]
        addresses: [192.168.0.24, 203.12.160.35]
      routes:
        - to: default
          via: 192.168.0.1
```

The addresses in the `nameservers` section are the local IP of bnehyp02 (the same IP address set in the `addresses` section), and the IP of my [internet service provider's DNS address](https://support.tpg.com.au/manually-setting-dns-server), so those will probably be different for you.

You might find some alternate sources on the net that use 'gateway4' instead of 'routes', so that might work if you're using a slightly different version of the easy-to-use configuration tools that Ubuntu has bequeathed us.

Anyway, once you've done that, run

```
sudo netplan --debug apply
```

to apply those changes, and then you should be able to do things like `ping bnenas04` instead of `ping bnenas04.dev.randomnoun`.

## Getting VNC and RDP working again

Also not DHCP/DNS related, but if you foolishly performed a `sudo apt-get upgrade`, then you might discover that you can't VNC or RDP into the server any more. 

Or you can, but the screen shown on the remote display is completely black. 

To fix that, disable Wayland by editting `/etc/gdm3/custom.conf` and uncomment this line

```
WaylandEnable=false
```

and then restart gnome by running

```
sudo systemctl restart gdm3
```

Instructions copied [from here](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-enable-disable-wayland-on-ubuntu-22-04-desktop).

It's this sort of malarky which may explain why I still prefer using Windows as my main OS. Anyway. Onwards.
