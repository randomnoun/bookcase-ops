So you'll need a DNS server, because the DNS servers inside kubernetes seem to be mostly for directing traffic within kubernetes. And you'll need DHCP to bootstrap DNS.

## Overview

OK so my local network will have a domain suffix of `.dev.randomnoun` and the hosts within that suffix are allocated IPs in the 192.168.0.x subnet.

The various hostnames and aliases below correspond to the various boxes on [SETUP-ARCHITECTURE.md](SETUP-ARCHITECTURE.md)

I'm running DHCP/DNS services  on a box outside the cluster, but I guess we could burn up some more resources on `bnehyp05` and do it there instead.

You could probably configure this on your wifi/internet router if your router has a DNS server in it, which it probably does.

In this setup, I'm using:

* **isc-dhcp-server** for DHCP ( IP address discovery, DNS discovery ), and 
* **bind** to provide DNS ( domain name -> IP address )

Actually, if you do install isc-dhcp-server / bind , you'll probably have to disable DHCP on your router, if your router has a DHCP server in it, which it probably does.

You might be able to get away with updating your hosts file ( `/etc/hosts` on linux, `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows ) instead of running bind.



## Installing isc-dhcp-server

```
sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
```

## Configuring isc-dhcp-server

* Add this to the end of /etc/dhcpd.conf:

```
# all the custom stuff
include "/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.local";
```

* Create a `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.local` file

If you're reading this and you're not me, then the things you probably want to change are:
* the artficial top-level domain ( `dev.randomnoun` )
* the IP address for your gateway ( `192.168.0.1` )
* the IP address for your ISP's DNS server ( `203.12.160.35` )
* any of the other IP addresses I guess, seeing those are going to be on your local network. I'm using `192.168.0.x` as my local subnet.

Contents of `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.local` file: 

```
# option definitions common to all supported networks
option domain-name "dev.randomnoun";

# DNS servers are bnehyp02, then TPG if it's down
# If TPG isn't your ISP then use your ISP's DNS here
option domain-name-servers 192.168.0.24, 203.12.160.35;

default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

# going to dish out IPs from 192.168.0.x
option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255;
option routers 192.168.0.1;

# IPs for unknown devices will range from 192.168.0.200 - 192.168.0.250
subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 192.168.0.200 192.168.0.250;
}

# MAC -> IP mappings
include "/etc/dhcp/dhcpd-hosts.conf";
```

* Create a `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd-hosts.conf` file.

If you're reading this and you're not me, then the things you probably want to change are:

* Pretty much everything. The hostnames below are the hosts in [SETUP-ARCHITECTURE.md](SETUP-ARCHITECTURE.md) which you'll probably have different names for
* The MAC addresses are the physical MACs on those boxes
* Apart from the virtual machine addresses, which were randomly generated by using [https://dnschecker.org/mac-address-generator.php](https://dnschecker.org/mac-address-generator.php) with a prefix of '00:00:' so it's a bit easier to see which ones are the randomly generated ones.

* Restart isc-dhcp-server via `sudo service isc-dhcp-server restart`
* Check status via `sudo service isc-dhcp-server status`
* Fix up any errors that might be appearing in `/var/log/syslog` 


## Installing bind

Steps to do that:

```
sudo apt-get install bind
```

## Configuring bind


* Add this to the end of `/etc/bind/named.conf.local`

```
zone "dev.randomnoun" {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/db.dev.randomnoun";
};
zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
        type master;
        notify no;
        file "/etc/bind/db.192";
};
```

* Create the file  `/etc/bind/db.dev.randomnoun` containing:

```

Well yes, I've had the bookcase for a while, and this is not the entire list of crap I've got connecting to this network.
