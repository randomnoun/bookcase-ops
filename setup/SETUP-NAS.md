# bookcase-ops NAS

This project has been tested on the free version of [TrueNAS SCALE](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/).

TrueNAS is the successor to FreeNAS, and 'TrueNAS SCALE' is the version of TrueNAS that runs on linux, which you are definitely going to prefer to FreeBSD the first time you want to run 
something on there that you need to install yourself. 

The TrueNAS server in this project is called `bnenas04.dev.randomnoun`, so if you want to call it something different then do a search & replace on that.
